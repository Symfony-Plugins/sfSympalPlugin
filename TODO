## 1.0

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Fix inline editing save to use one request instead one request per slot.
* Enhance rss, xml formats to have a filter so we can customize what data is returned
for each model and even for each different format type.

### Performance

#### Eliminate Joins

* Cache sfSympalContentType data so we do not need to join it on content and menu item queries
* Cache Site record for application and remove Site join from menu and content queries
* Add denormalized cache for list of groups on content record and menu items to avoid m2m joins to retrieve groups

#### Possibilities?

* Test if loading content slots in another query is faster than left joining them in the main query.

### New Documentation Chapters

* Customizing the Sympal Admin
* Themes
* Content Templates
* Redirects
* Overriding Stylesheets and Javascripts
* Asset Types
* Content Lists

## 1.1
